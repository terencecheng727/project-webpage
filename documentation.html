                        <p>My project, Shifts in Government Spending in Canadaâ€”An Analysis and Review of Canada's Healthcare Industry, 
                        serves as a comprehensive analysis of Canadian federal government financial data. The primary purpose of this project is to go 
                        beyond surface-level statistics and uncover a compelling narrative within the data by focusing on a specific sector.
                        <br><br>
                        The project's scope is defined by its two main components:
                        <br><br>
                        <ol>
                            <li><i>&#9679; Macro-level Analysis:</i></li> This involves examining broad trends in federal government revenue, expenditure, and budgetary 
                            balance over several decades from Statistics Canada. This foundational analysis helps to identify key spending priorities and 
                            establish a long-term context for Canada's financial decisions.
                            <br><br>
                            <li><i>&#9679; Micro-level Analysis:</i></li>The project then narrows its focus to a single, critical area: the healthcare industry. By concentrating 
                            on this sector, the analysis explores how a consistent increase in spending has been accompanied by persistent challenges, such as long 
                            emergency room wait times and staffing issues. The goal is to illustrate that while financial investment is crucial, it doesn't always 
                            directly solve systemic problems.
                            <br><br>
                            In essence, the project's purpose is to transform a vast dataset into a clear, compelling story that highlights how a nation's budget 
                            reflects its evolving values and ongoing challenges. The project also acknowledges that while correlations can be observed, no statistical 
                            significance has been calculated.
                        </ol>

                        <p>The foundation of this project is a robust, multi-faceted research approach that combines a comprehensive dataset with a 
                        targeted, deep dive into specific trends.
                        <br><br>
                        <u><b>Data Sources</b></u>
                        <br><br>
                        The core financial data for this analysis was sourced from the Revenue, expenditure and budgetary balance - General governments dataset, 
                        which is publicly available from the Government of Canada's Open Data portal. This dataset provides a long-term view of federal 
                        financial trends, from 1961 to 2024, enabling a historical perspective on government spending and revenue.
                        <br><br>

                        <u><b>Collaborative Research</b></u>
                        <br><br>
                        A significant portion of the analysis, particularly the deep dive into healthcare, was developed in collaboration with Glory Nwokeji. 
                        Her research, titled "ER wait times and Factors that affect them in Canada: Comparative Study between Ontario, Quebec and Saskatchewan", 
                        provided critical, on-the-ground context for the financial data. Her work highlights the tangible impacts of federal spending on the 
                        healthcare system, focusing on issues like prolonged emergency room wait times and staffing shortages. This collaboration was essential 
                        for connecting the macro-level financial trends to real-world outcomes.
                        <br><br>
                        <u><b>Key Findings</b></u>
                        <br><br>
                        The data analysis reveals several noteworthy findings about Canadian federal spending:
                        <br><br>
                        <ol>
                            <li><i>&#9679; Consistent Priorities:</i></li> Since 1961, "Goods and Services" and "Defence" have consistently ranked among the top 10 annual 
                            expenditures. This indicates these areas are enduring priorities for the federal government, regardless of the political party in power.
                            <br><br>
                            <li><i>&#9679; Employment Insurance:</i></li> "Employment Insurance benefits" did not appear in the top 10 expenditures in the early 1960s, a 
                            period when the program was already established. This highlights the fact that while a program exists, its financial prominence can 
                            fluctuate significantly based on economic and social factors.
                            <br><br>
                            <li><i>&#9679; Old Age Security:</i></li> "Old Age Security" has also been a recurring top-ten expenditure. Its consistent presence reflects 
                            Canada's aging population and the long-term commitment to social welfare programs.
                        </ol>

                        <p>
                        <u><b>Project Limitations</b></u>
                        <br><br>
                        Every project, regardless of its scale, has limitations that shape its outcomes. In this project, the primary challenge was managing a 
                        vast, macro-level dataset. While a broad analysis was the initial goal, the sheer size and complexity of the data made it difficult to 
                        identify a clear narrative. This experience underscored the importance of scoping a project to a manageable size, a lesson that was 
                        applied when the focus shifted to a more specific, story-driven analysis of healthcare spending.
                        <br><br>
                        A second significant limitation was the time investment in learning new software, specifically Power BI. While a powerful tool for data 
                        visualization, the steep learning curve for a beginner proved to be a time-consuming obstacle. In retrospect, focusing on a more familiar 
                        tool or a simpler project for the initial learning phase would have been a more efficient approach.
                        <br><br>
                        <u><b>Future Work</b></u>
                        <br><br>
                        <ol>
                            <li><i>&#9679; Exploring Additional Correlational Data:</i></li> The current analysis of financial data could be strengthened by integrating 
                            additional datasets. For instance, data on population demographics, major economic events, or a detailed timeline of key legislative 
                            changes in Canadian history could provide more direct and provable correlations to the observed shifts in government spending.
                            <br><br>
                            <li><i>&#9679; Expanding the Analysis:</i></li> While the current analysis focuses on healthcare spending, future work could apply a 
                            similar methodology to other sectors. Examining trends in defence spending, social security, or infrastructure over time would offer 
                            a more comprehensive understanding of Canadian fiscal priorities.
                            <br><br>
                            <li><i>&#9679; Enhancing the Website:</i></li> The project's website can be improved to be more dynamic and interactive. Future iterations 
                            could include a feature that allows users to select different expenditure categories and time periods, generating custom visualizations 
                            in real time. This would transform the website from a static report into an interactive analytical tool.
